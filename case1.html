            About me<br>
            
            First off my favorite colors in magic are as follows
            <ol>
                <li>Red</li>
                <li>Black</li>
                <li>White</li>
                <li>Green</li>
                <li>Blue</li>
            </ol>
           Everybody hates blue.

            I'm 24 and am starting school back up later than I'd hoped. I've worked at a country club, windows and shutters warehouse and a drone warehouse.<br>
            I've learned that working as labor is the worst, ever. That fact drove me to school and software engineering,<br>
            which pays well, is also a skill that I’ve touched upon in the past and I believe I can mold into something powerful.<br>
            <br>
            </p>
            <p>
            On to lighter topics, I have lots of hobbies, the major one being tabletop gaming, particularly Magic the Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons.<br>
            Yeah, I’m a big nerd, but both of those games are played by very intelligent people from multiple walks of life.<br>
            They also facilitate a nice relaxed place to go and hang out with friends which is probably the biggest draw, <br>
            aside from MTG being called cardboard-crack.
